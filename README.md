# Sales-Insights--Tableau
Tools Used: Tableau, Mysql,Google Sheets, Data Wrangling.
Data was taken from the one of the hardware company in the form of .sql format and Google Sheets
Mysql database has all sales transactions, customers, products and markets information.
I have analyse this database and than hook it up with Tableau.
In Tableau I perform ETL and data cleaning operations to make it ready so that we can build our dashboard.
Then build a powerful dashboard that can help us generate sales insights on hardware business.
